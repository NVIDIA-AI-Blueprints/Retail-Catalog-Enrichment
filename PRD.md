# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Catalog Enrichment System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 15-Sept-2025  
**Owner:** Antonio Martinez (NVIDIA)

## Problem Statement

Product catalogs often contain minimal, low-quality information with basic product images and sparse descriptions. This limits customer engagement, search discoverability, and overall user experience. Manual enrichment of catalog data is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale. Human categorization and tagging of products is particularly susceptible to inconsistencies, subjective interpretations, and classification errors that can negatively impact search functionality and user experience.

## Solution Overview

A GenAI-powered catalog enrichment system that transforms basic product images into comprehensive, rich catalog entries with enhanced titles, descriptions, categories, tags, variation images (2D/3D), and short video clips.

## Core User Flow

1. **Input**: User submits one or multiple images of a product
2. **Content Analysis**: System uses NVIDIA Nemotron VLM (https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-nano-vl-8b-v1) to extract and generate:
   - Enhanced product title
   - Detailed product description
   - Relevant categories
   - Product tags
3. **Prompt Planning**: System uses NVIDIA Nemotron LLM to create optimized prompts for image generation based on product analysis
4. **Image Generation**: System creates variation images using FLUX models with prompts generated by Nemotron LLM
5. **3D Asset Creation**: System generates 3D product assets using Microsoft's TRELLIS model (https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/trellis)
6. **Video Generation**: System produces 3-5 second product video clips using open-source models
7. **Output**: Enriched catalog entry with all generated assets

### FR-4: 3D Asset Generation
- Integrate Microsoft TRELLIS model
- Generate 3D models from 2D product images
- Export 3D assets in standard formats
- Ensure model quality and accuracy

### FR-5: Video Clip Generation
- Create 3-5 second product video clips
- Use open-source video generation models
- Generate smooth, professional-quality clips
- Support common video formats (MP4, WebM)

### FR-6: Language Selection
- Support multiple output languages including English, Spanish, and French
- Generate product titles, descriptions, categories, and tags in selected language
- Maintain language consistency across all text outputs

## User Stories

### US-1: Basic Product Enrichment
**As a** catalog manager  
**I want to** upload a product image and receive enriched catalog data  
**So that** I can quickly populate my catalog with detailed product information

### US-2: Batch Processing
**As a** catalog manager  
**I want to** process multiple products simultaneously  
**So that** I can efficiently enrich large catalog datasets

### US-3: Asset Generation
**As a** marketing team member  
**I want to** receive multiple image variations and video content  
**So that** I can use diverse assets across different marketing channels

### US-4: 3D Visualization
**As a** e-commerce platform  
**I want to** display 3D product models  
**So that** customers can interact with products before purchase

## Success Criteria

- **Processing Time**: <1 minute per product for complete enrichment
- **Content Quality**: Generated descriptions and titles achieve >90% relevance rating
- **Asset Generation**: Successfully generate 2D variations, 3D models, and video clips for >95% of input products
